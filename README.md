# Layoffs Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of layoffs data collected from various companies across different industries and locations. The aim was to understand the trends, relationships, and insights from the layoffs dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Dash
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was collected from [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/) and is available [here](https://layoffs.fyi/). The data availability spans from 11 March 2020 (when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic) to 16 October 2023. It includes columns such as:
- 'company': Company name
- 'location': Location of the company
- 'industry': Industry to which the company belongs
- 'total_laid_off': Total number of employees laid off
- 'percentage_laid_off': Percentage of employees laid off
- 'date': Date of layoffs
- 'stage': Stage of the company
- 'country': Country of the company
- 'funds_raised': Funds raised by the company

## Insights Gained
1. **Top 10 Companies with the Maximum Layoffs:** Identified the companies with the highest number of layoffs.
2. **Top 3 Companies with Layoffs Year-wise:** Examined the top companies with layoffs in each year.
3. **Top 3 Locations with Most Layoffs Year-wise:** Analyzed the locations where most layoffs occurred each year.
4. **Top 20 Companies Laying Off x% of Employees:** Identified companies based on the percentage of employees laid off.
5. **Top 10 Countries with Most Layoffs:** Discovered countries with the highest layoffs.
6. **Top 10 Locations with Most Layoffs in the USA:** Analyzed the locations with the highest layoffs within the USA.
